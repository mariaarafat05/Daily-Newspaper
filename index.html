                    Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879. 
                    His parents, secular Ashkenazi Jews, were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. 
                    In 1880, the family moved to Munich's borough of Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt, where Einstein's father and 
                    his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.

                    When he was very young, his parents worried that he had a learning disability because he was very slow to learn to talk.
                    When he was five and sick in bed, his father brought him a compass. This sparked his lifelong fascination with electromagnetism.
                    He realized that "Something deeply hidden had to be behind things.
                    Einstein attended St. Peter's Catholic elementary school in Munich from the age of five.
                    When he was eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium, where he received advanced primary and then secondary school education.
